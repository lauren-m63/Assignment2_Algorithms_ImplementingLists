/*
mplement a Doubly Linked List that stores Song instances
You will implement two classes from scratch, DLNode and DLList. Your DLList class must implement
the following operations:
• An empty constructor: Should create an empty DLList. This implies having a member data element
Head of type DLNode initialized to NULL.
• void addy(Song s): Should add a new DLNode with the given song to the DLList and update the
pointers appropriately.
• void removy(int pos): Should remove the item at position pos from the DLList. This implies
updating the pointers appropriately.
• String toString(): This method should return a string containing all the elements in the DLList. Each
element should be in a new line when the resulting String is printed.
